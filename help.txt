For example, gender, educational level, hair color are categorical.<br /><h3>Date</h3>Date date contains dates. Dates are subsets of categorical data but has been extracted specifically for ease of use.</p><p>If you want to read more about the differences between data types, Stephen Few\'s <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/dmreview/quant_vs_cat_data.pdf">article</a> is a good read.</div></body></html>
