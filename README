Protoviewer is a web-based online design environment for rendering beautiful data visualizations rapidly using Protovis. It is designed to be user-friendly and modular. 

The following libraries are used:

* protovis 3.2
* jQuery and jQuery UI  
* CodeMirror by Marijn Haverbeke for the code editor and syntax highlighting
* canviz, a JS library for Graphviz, from which I modified their ColorBrewer mapping.
* Pretty Print for Javascript by James Padolsey for the rendering of the JSON viewer
* jquery.editable by Mika Tuupola for inline editing of the data viewer
* RGB to HTML/Hex for converting ColorBrewer RGB to hexadecimal
* JSLint by Douglas Crockford, for parsing and evaluating user inputted JavaScript and CSV.
